# This is strict check that ensures no string interpolation are being done
# inside `run: ...` blocks of GitHub Workflows and Composite Actions.

# This rule, in contrast to https://registry.semgrep.dev/rule/yaml.github-actions.security.run-shell-injection,
# doesn't take the assumption that anything that isn't coming from `github.event`
# is safe and instead enforces to not use string interpolations inside shell scripts.
